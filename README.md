# About

This is a small heroku app to bridge between sales delivered in Squarespace and Moodle.
It should allow the course admin to:

- see what sales have happened for what courses listed in Squarespace
- extract info about the purchasers
- push a cohort of users into moodle

# Qucickstart

## Starting the project locally

For Heroku settings info have a look at https://realpython.com/blog/python/flask-by-example-part-1-project-setup/

Running locally using the fish shell

```
> set -x APP_SETTINGS "config.DevelopmentConfig"
> set -x DATABASE_URL "postgresql://localhost/sage"
> set -x BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD "randompass"
> set -x BASIC_AUTH_USERNAME "randomuser"
> python3 runserver.py 
```

# Setup

# Relationship between squarespace transactions, bridge users and moodle users

We are going to make the assumption that the email has to be unique across registrations.
When someone purchases a course on squarepsace we have the following kinds of info about them

PersonIdentier -> email
Person -> email, name
Affiliation -> department, title, other academic related info
Course -> title, instance, transaction

We want to create a moodle user that is a one to one relationship with the Person
who is purchasing the courses.

One person over time can purchase many courses.
They may enter their names differently.

For the simplest demo application we will just create a system that uses only email
to id the user in our bridge system. We can later create a table for person info.
